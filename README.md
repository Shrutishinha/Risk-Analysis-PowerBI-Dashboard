# Risk Analysis Power BI Dashboard  
### Business Intelligence • Risk Management • Data Analytics  

A professional business intelligence solution designed to convert organizational risk data into actionable insights through structured analytics and interactive visualization.

---

## 1. Project Overview  

Organizations today generate large volumes of operational data. However, without proper analytical systems, this data remains underutilized.

The Risk Analysis Power BI Dashboard was developed to address this challenge by providing a centralized, data-driven platform for monitoring, evaluating, and managing business risks in real time.

This system enables decision-makers to transition from manual reporting to intelligent, automated analysis.

---

## 2. Problem Statement  

Traditional risk assessment methods often suffer from:

- Manual data processing  
- Limited visibility into risk patterns  
- Delayed reporting  
- Lack of predictive insights  

As a result, organizations struggle to respond effectively to emerging risks.

This project solves these limitations by introducing a structured, automated, and interactive reporting mechanism.

---

## 3. Project Objectives  

Based on the identified challenges, the project aims to:

- Identify high-risk operational processes  
- Quantify risk severity and frequency  
- Analyze observation significance  
- Monitor performance trends over time  
- Enable proactive risk mitigation  

Each objective directly supports improved organizational governance.

## 4. System Architecture  

The solution follows a layered analytical architecture.

### Data Layer  
Stores raw and processed datasets in Excel and CSV formats.

### Processing Layer  
Uses Power Query for data transformation and validation.

### Analytics Layer  
Implements DAX measures and KPIs.

### Visualization Layer  
Delivers insights through Power BI dashboards.

This modular design ensures scalability and maintainability.
